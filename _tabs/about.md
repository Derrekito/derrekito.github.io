## Overview

Computer engineer working on radiation testing and performance benchmarking of microelectronics for space applications.

Focus areas include:

- Characterization of COTS processors under total ionizing dose (TID) and single event effects (SEE)
- Development of internal tools for real-time data acquisition and post-test analysis
- Execution of test campaigns supporting part selection and survivability assessments

Also pursuing a Ph.D. in Electrical & Computer Engineering, with research centered on radiation resiliency in modern compute architectures.
