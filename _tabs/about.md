## Overview

Senior Computer Engineer and Ph.D. student in Electrical & Computer Engineering at the University of New Mexico.

I build tools for testing and benchmarking microelectronics, develop real-time data acquisition systems, and create synthetic datasets for AI/ML training. I also mentor early-career researchers through to publication.

## Current Work

- **RADCaST**: Real-time data acquisition framework for test campaigns
- **SPARCL**: Cross-architecture benchmarking suite for processor evaluation
- Performance characterization of NVIDIA and AMD processors
- Synthetic satellite imagery datasets for space domain awareness

## Skills

**Languages**: C/C++, Python, Bash, CUDA, HTML/CSS, JavaScript

**Tools**: Neovim, Git, Docker, Docker Compose, GNU Make, GDB, LaTeX, MongoDB, MQTT, VMware, Vivado, Vitis, Yocto

**Frameworks**: Dash, Plotly, Pandas, Matplotlib
